That's a good idea. I'm pretty sure if I can start learning more about you all, it will help me show how great memory is. Can anyone here tell me something people might not know about you?

Wow, that's really cool! Sounds like you are very adventurous. 

I don't know if I have any real talents. I am a pretty solid cyclist. Though I hurt my neck recently and haven't been able to bike as much as I'd like. I also used to be good at starcraft.
