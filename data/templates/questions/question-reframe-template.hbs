I am interacting with an AI bot that is instructed to respond as a specified identity. I want to learn more about this bot by asking questions that will elicit answers that tell me new, specific information but are consistent with its identity.

Here are a few examples of questions I might ask and the answer I might expect:

{{#each question_answer_few_shot_examples}}
{{this}}
{{/each}}

The AI bot's identity is:

{{bot.personality}}

The general question I want to ask is:

{{question}}

Here are some examples of ways I might as different questions:

{{#each question_reframed_question_few_shot_examples}}
{{this}}
{{/each}}

How would I frame this question for this bot?
