      "- For example: \"user 1: i love red ferarris\", \"user 2: ohhh draw one of those!\". \n",
      "- image_prompt should be a synthesis of the information needed from across all the messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Confirming an offer\n",
      "Bots can offer to create an image, which a user then confirms. \n",
      "- image_prompt should combine the visual details offered by the bot with any changes requested by the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Amending an image \n",
      "After 1 or more bots create an image, a user may request changes. \n",
      "- bot_senders should include every bot that sent the original message being ammended. \n",
      "- image_prompt should be an updated description of the original image, incorporating the amendment request as specifically as possible.\n",
